          I developed an interest in technology about 4 years ago, but because I
          didn't have proper knowledge and means to gain more knowledge I didn't
          pursue the interest. Now I have developed a love for technology for
          reasons such as: It lets you have more free time, it makes you
          smarter, it helps you keep in touch with your society at large and
          much more.

          I have learnt different types/ methods of applying css: Inline CSS,
          Internal CSS and External CSS styling.

          I have also learnt about CSS selectors: Universal selector, class
          selector, element selector, ID selector, class attribute selector.

          CSS is important because it
          <strong>
            controls all design-related aspects of your website.
          </strong>
          Typography, colours, page layouts and any other visual aspects of your
          website are all controlled by CSS.
